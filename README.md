# Color-Palette
In this color palette UI, the user is able to see a list of different colors and choose their favorite colors by clicking on the color "liking" it. Once the user "likes" a color, the color will show at the top of their screen along with any other color they "liked". If they no longer like a color in their favorites, there is an "x" that they can click on to remove it.
